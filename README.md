I am a software engineering student with a passion for both frontend and backend development, working on improving my full stack development skills!

**What I'm up to**
- This semester my classes are focused on Web Development (HTML, JavaScript, & MongoDB) and Secure Programming & Penetration Testing practices (XSS attacks, CSRF attacks, Buffer Overflow attacks, etc) .
- I am also working part time as a software engineer intern at Medtronic during the school year, and plan to work full time as an intern this summer.
- I have some personal projects in the works that I can't wait to share, and a Senior Software Development Project coming in the near future!
