**What I'm up to**
- My final semester of college will be spent focusing on my Senior Software Development project where we will be hosting a Computer Vision web application made with React.js and hosted through the AWS pipeline.
- I am also developing a personal portfolio to help better display my skills to future employers!
- I have some other personal projects in the works that I just can't wait to share! :)
